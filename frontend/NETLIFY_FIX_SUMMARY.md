# Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing with the error:
```
[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'
```

## Root Cause
The [tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js) file was requiring the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin, but it wasn't installed as a dependency in [package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json).

## Solution Applied
1. **Added the missing dependency**: Added `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` to devDependencies in [package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json)
2. **Optimized the configuration**: Since Tailwind CSS v3.3+ includes line-clamp by default, we removed the redundant plugin from [tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js)
3. **Cleaned up dependencies**: Removed the unnecessary `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` dependency from [package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json)

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build` without errors
- Confirmed that the build completes successfully with no warnings
- Verified that the line-clamp functionality still works (it's built into Tailwind CSS v3.3+)

## Additional Notes
The fix addresses the immediate deployment issue and also optimizes the configuration by removing redundant dependencies. The application should now deploy successfully on Netlify.
