# Deployment Verification Summary

## Issues Fixed and Verified

### 1. Netlify Deployment Error
**Problem**: `[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'`
**Fix Applied**: 
- Added `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` dependency to package.json
- Optimized configuration since line-clamp is built into Tailwind CSS v3.3+
- Removed redundant dependency after confirming built-in functionality
**Verification**: Build now completes successfully without module resolution errors

### 2. File Serving Issues
**Problem**: Uploaded files (images and ZIP files) not displaying or downloading correctly
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated file URLs in PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx to use correct `/uploads/` path
- Added explicit Content-Disposition headers in backend for proper file handling
- Fixed file name display in download section of ProjectDetailsModal.jsx
**Verification**: Files now display correctly in gallery view and download properly

### 3. Project Details Modal Issues
**Problem**: Auto-advance functionality, screenshot visibility, IST timestamps, download behavior
**Fix Applied**:
- Improved auto-advance to cycle through screenshots only
- Fixed screenshot visibility by correcting file URLs
- Added proper Indian Standard Time (IST) formatting for timestamps
- Made download links open in new tabs instead of overriding current page
**Verification**: Modal now works correctly with all fixed behaviors

### 4. Frontend-Backend Connectivity
**Problem**: Issues with frontend accessing backend API endpoints
**Fix Applied**:
- Verified API_BASE configuration in apiConfig.js
- Confirmed proper CORS configuration in backend
- Fixed file serving routes in backend
**Verification**: Frontend can now successfully communicate with backend API
