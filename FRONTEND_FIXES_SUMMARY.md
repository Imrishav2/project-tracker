# Frontend Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. File Serving URLs in PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx
**Problem**: Incorrect URLs for serving uploaded files in the project gallery view
**Fix**: Updated URLs to use the correct `/uploads/` path prefix

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
src={`${API_BASE}/${submission.screenshot_path}`}

// After (correct)
src={`${API_BASE}/uploads/${submission.screenshot_path}`}
```

### 2. Additional Screenshots URLs in PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx
**Problem**: Incorrect URLs for additional screenshots in the project gallery view
**Fix**: Updated URLs to use the correct `/uploads/` path prefix

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
src={`${API_BASE}/${screenshot}`}

// After (correct)
src={`${API_BASE}/uploads/${screenshot}`}
```

### 3. File Name Display in ProjectDetailsModal.jsx
**Problem**: Incorrect file name display in the download section showing current file instead of actual file
**Fix**: Updated to show the correct file name for each download option

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
<span className="text-sm text-gray-500">{allFiles[currentImageIndex].path.split('/').pop().split('\\').pop()}</span>

// After (correct)
<span className="text-sm text-gray-500">{file.path.split('/').pop().split('\\').pop()}</span>
```

### 4. Content-Disposition Headers in Backend (app.py)
**Problem**: Images were sometimes opening in the browser instead of displaying inline
**Fix**: Added explicit Content-Disposition header for images

```python
# Before
if filename.lower().endswith(('.zip', '.rar', '.7z')):
    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{filename}"'

# After
if filename.lower().endswith(('.zip', '.rar', '.7z')):
    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{filename}"'
else:
    # For images, ensure they are displayed inline
    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'inline'
```

## Verification Steps

1. **File URLs**: Verified that all file URLs now correctly point to `/uploads/` path
2. **Download Links**: Confirmed that download links use `target="_blank"` to open in new tabs
3. **File Name Display**: Ensured each download option shows the correct file name
4. **Content Headers**: Added proper Content-Disposition headers for different file types

## Testing Performed

- Verified that screenshot previews now load correctly in the project gallery
- Confirmed that download links open in new tabs instead of the same window
- Checked that file names display correctly in the download section
- Tested that ZIP files download properly instead of opening in the browser

## Additional Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in image loading with better user feedback

These fixes address all the issues mentioned in the user feedback:
- Screenshot previews now visible directly in the project gallery view
- Download links open in new tabs instead of overriding the current page
- File names display correctly in the download section
- ZIP files download properly instead of opening in the browser
