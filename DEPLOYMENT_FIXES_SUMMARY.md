# Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix deployment issues on Render and Netlify.

## Issues Identified

1. **psycopg2 compatibility issue**: The error `undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get` indicated a compatibility issue between psycopg2 and Python 3.13 on Render.

2. **Database migration issue**: Schema changes for existing deployments were not handled properly.

3. **Python version compatibility**: Render was using Python 3.13 which had compatibility issues with some packages.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. psycopg2 Version Update
- Updated `backend/requirements.txt` to use `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` which is compatible with Python 3.13

### 2. Database Migration Improvements
- Enhanced `backend/migrate.py` to handle both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases
- Added proper error handling for existing columns
- Updated `backend/app.py` to gracefully handle schema changes

### 3. Python Version Specification
- Added `render.yaml` to specify Python 3.11 for Render deployment
- Added `backend/runtime.txt` to specify Python 3.11.9

### 4. Build Script Improvements
- Updated `build.sh` to run migrations before starting the application
- Added better error handling and logging

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved `backend/diagnose.py` to provide more detailed environment information
- Added better error messages in the application startup process

### 6. Multiple Screenshot Support
- Added `additional_screenshots` column to the Submission model
- Updated frontend components to support multiple screenshot uploads
- Created ProjectDetailsModal for displaying multiple screenshots in a carousel

## Testing

All changes have been tested locally to ensure:
- Frontend builds successfully
- Backend starts without errors
- Database schema is correctly updated
- Multiple screenshot functionality works
- API endpoints function properly

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push all changes to the main branch
2. Render will automatically deploy using the updated configuration
3. Netlify will automatically deploy the frontend

The application should now deploy successfully on both platforms without the previous errors.
