# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Psycopg2 Compatibility Issue**: The deployment was failing with an ImportError related to psycopg2 compatibility with Python 3.13:
   ```
   ImportError: /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
   ```

2. **User Viewing Experience**: The screenshot previews were not showing properly in the project gallery view, only showing a zip option.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Psycopg2 Compatibility Fix

- **Downgraded psycopg2-binary**: Changed from version 2.9.7 to 2.9.5 in [requirements.txt](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/backend/requirements.txt) for better compatibility with Python 3.13
- **Enhanced build script**: Updated [build.sh](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/build.sh) with better error handling and explicit installation steps
- **Specified Python version**: Set Python version to 3.11.9 in both [render.yaml](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/render.yaml) and [runtime.txt](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/backend/runtime.txt)
- **Improved error handling**: Enhanced [wsgi.py](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/backend/wsgi.py) and [diagnose.py](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/backend/diagnose.py) with better error handling and logging

### 2. User Viewing Experience Enhancement

- **Added screenshot previews**: Implemented direct screenshot previews in the gallery view in [PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/src/PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx)
- **Multiple screenshot support**: Added support for showing multiple screenshots in the gallery view
- **Placeholder icons**: Added placeholder icons for projects without screenshots
- **Error handling**: Improved error handling for image loading

### Frontend
- [frontend/src/PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/src/PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx): Added screenshot preview functionality

## Testing

All changes have been tested locally to ensure:
1. The application builds successfully
2. The database migrations work correctly
3. The screenshot previews display properly
4. The error handling works as expected

## Deployment

To deploy these fixes:
1. Push the changes to the main branch
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
4. Verify the frontend is working correctly on Netlify

The fixes should resolve both the deployment failure and enhance the user viewing experience.
