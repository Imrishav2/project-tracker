# Deployment and UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Psycopg2 Compatibility Issue**: The deployment was failing with an ImportError related to psycopg2 compatibility with Python 3.13
2. **Screenshot Viewing Experience**: Users had to click through images one by one instead of being able to scroll through all screenshots easily

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Psycopg2 Compatibility Fix

- **Enhanced build script**: Updated [build.sh](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/build.sh) with `--no-cache-dir` flag for cleaner installations
- **Explicit Python version specification**: Added `RENDER_PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable in [render.yaml](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/render.yaml)
- **Maintained psycopg2-binary version**: Kept version 2.9.5 which is compatible with Python 3.11.9

### 2. Screenshot Viewing Experience Enhancement

- **Auto-advance feature**: Added automatic image cycling every 3 seconds when multiple images are present
- **Keyboard navigation**: Implemented arrow key navigation for easier browsing
- **Improved instructions**: Added user guidance for navigation controls
- **Better image display**: Increased image container height for better visibility
- **Enhanced user feedback**: Added image counter with clear navigation instructions

## Files Modified

### Backend
- [build.sh](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/build.sh): Enhanced build process with better installation flags
- [render.yaml](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/render.yaml): Added explicit Python version specification

### Frontend
- [frontend/src/components/ProjectDetailsModal.jsx](file:///c%3A/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/src/components/ProjectDetailsModal.jsx): Enhanced screenshot viewing experience with auto-advance, keyboard navigation, and better UI

## Testing

All changes have been tested locally to ensure:
1. The build process works correctly with the updated script
2. The Python version is properly specified
3. The screenshot viewing experience is improved with auto-advance and keyboard navigation
4. The UI is responsive and user-friendly

## Deployment

To deploy these fixes:
1. Push the changes to the main branch
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
4. Verify the frontend is working correctly on Netlify

The fixes should resolve the deployment failure and enhance the user viewing experience for project screenshots.
