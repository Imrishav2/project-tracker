Fix Netlify deployment error and enhance project viewing experience

## Netlify Deployment Fix
- Resolved "[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'" error
- Added missing @tailwindcss/line-clamp dependency to package.json
- Optimized configuration since line-clamp is built into Tailwind CSS v3.3+
- Cleaned up redundant dependencies

## Frontend-Backend Connectivity Improvements
- Fixed file serving URLs in PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx to use correct /uploads/ path
- Corrected additional screenshots URLs in project gallery view
- Fixed file name display in ProjectDetailsModal.jsx download section
- Added proper Content-Disposition headers in backend for file handling

## Project Viewing Experience Enhancements
- Screenshot previews now visible directly in project gallery view
- Download links open in new tabs instead of overriding current page
- File names display correctly in download section
- ZIP files download properly instead of opening in browser
- Auto-advance functionality works correctly for screenshots only
- Timestamps display in Indian Standard Time (IST)
- Improved error handling with better user feedback

## Files Modified
- frontend/src/components/ProjectDetailsModal.jsx
- frontend/src/PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx
- frontend/package.json
- backend/app.py

## Testing
- Verified Netlify build completes successfully
- Confirmed file gallery displays screenshot previews correctly
- Tested project details modal with all fixed features
- Validated proper file download behavior
- Checked timestamp formatting in IST
- Verified all download links open in new tabs

Fixes all deployment and user experience issues reported in recent feedback.
