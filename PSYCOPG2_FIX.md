# Psycopg2 Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The deployment was failing with a compatibility error between psycopg2-binary version 2.9.7 and Python 3.13:
```
ImportError: /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
```

## Root Cause
Despite specifying psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 in requirements.txt, the deployment was still installing version 2.9.7. This was likely due to:
1. The build process installing psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 first, but then upgrading it when installing other dependencies
2. Potential caching issues

## Solution
Modified the build.sh script to:
1. Explicitly install psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 with --no-cache-dir flag
2. Verify the installation with `pip show psycopg2-binary`
3. Install other dependencies explicitly without using requirements.txt to avoid any potential conflicts

## Files Modified
- `build.sh` - Enhanced build process to ensure correct psycopg2-binary version is installed

## Testing
The changes have been committed and are ready for deployment. This should resolve the psycopg2 compatibility issue and allow the application to deploy successfully.
