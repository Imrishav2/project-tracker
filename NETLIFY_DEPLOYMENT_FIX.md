# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Problem
Netlify deployment was failing with the error:
```
[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'
Require stack:
- /opt/build/repo/frontend/tailwind.config.js
```

## Root Cause
The [tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js) file was requiring the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin, but it wasn't installed as a dependency.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Missing Dependency
Added `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` to the devDependencies in [frontend/package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json):
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@tailwindcss/line-clamp": "^0.4.4",
  // ... other dependencies
}
```

### 2. Optimized Configuration
Since Tailwind CSS v3.3+ includes line-clamp functionality by default, we optimized the [tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js) file:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    // @tailwindcss/line-clamp is included by default in Tailwind CSS v3.3+
  ],
}
```

### 3. Cleaned Up Redundant Dependencies
Removed the unnecessary `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` dependency from [frontend/package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json) since it's included by default in Tailwind CSS v3.3+.

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build` without errors
- Confirmed that the build completes successfully with no warnings
- Verified that the line-clamp functionality still works (it's built into Tailwind CSS v3.3+)

## Deployment Instructions
1. Push the updated code to your repository
2. Netlify should automatically deploy the site without the previous error
3. The build should complete successfully

## Additional Notes
The fix addresses both the immediate deployment issue and optimizes the configuration by removing redundant dependencies. The application should now deploy successfully on Netlify.
