# Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures all necessary steps are completed before deploying to Render and Netlify.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### Backend (Render)
- [x] Updated psycopg2-binary version in `backend/requirements.txt`
- [x] Added `render.yaml` to specify Python 3.11
- [x] Added `backend/runtime.txt` to specify Python 3.11.9
- [x] Enhanced database migration script in `backend/migrate.py`
- [x] Updated `build.sh` to run migrations before deployment
- [x] Tested database schema updates locally
- [x] Verified backend API endpoints work correctly
- [x] Tested multiple screenshot functionality

### Frontend (Netlify)
- [x] Verified frontend builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [x] Tested all frontend components
- [x] Verified multiple screenshot upload and display functionality
- [x] Checked responsive design on different screen sizes
- [x] Verified form validation and error handling

### General
- [x] Updated README.md with recent improvements
- [x] Created DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md documentation
- [x] Verified all environment variables are properly configured
- [x] Tested local development setup instructions

## Deployment Steps

### Render (Backend)
1. Push all changes to the main branch
2. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
3. Render will use Python 3.11 as specified
4. The `build.sh` script will run migrations
5. The application will start with the updated schema

### Netlify (Frontend)
1. Push all changes to the main branch
2. Netlify will automatically build the frontend
3. The build should complete successfully
4. The site will be deployed with all new features

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend
- [ ] Verify Render deployment completed without errors
- [ ] Check Render logs for any warnings or errors
- [ ] Test API endpoints using curl or Postman
- [ ] Verify database schema is correct
- [ ] Test multiple screenshot upload functionality

### Frontend
- [ ] Verify Netlify deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Test all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test form submission with multiple screenshots
- [ ] Verify project gallery displays correctly
- [ ] Test project details modal with multiple screenshots

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Revert to the previous working commit
2. Identify the specific issue causing the failure
3. Fix the issue and test locally
4. Deploy the fix in a new commit

## Monitoring

After deployment:
- [ ] Monitor Render logs for any errors
- [ ] Monitor Netlify deployment status
- [ ] Test the live application thoroughly
- [ ] Verify all features work as expected
