# Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve deployment issues on both Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend).

## Netlify Deployment Fix

### Issue
```
Could not resolve "./components/EnhancedUI.module.css?used" from "src/components/LandingPage.jsx"
```

### Root Cause
Components in the `frontend/src/components` directory were incorrectly importing CSS modules and other components with paths that included the `components` directory prefix when they were already in that directory.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed [LandingPage.jsx](file:///c:/whitelist%20project/frontend/src/components/LandingPage.jsx)**
   - Changed `import styles from './components/EnhancedUI.module.css'` to `import styles from './EnhancedUI.module.css'`
   - Fixed component imports:
     - Changed `import Button3D from './components/Button3D'` to `import Button3D from './Button3D'`
     - Changed `import { Card3D, StatsCard3D } from './components/EnhancedComponents'` to `import { Card3D, StatsCard3D } from './EnhancedComponents'`

2. **Fixed [EnhancedFormPage.jsx](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/src/components/EnhancedFormPage.jsx)**
   - Changed `import styles from './components/EnhancedUI.module.css'` to `import styles from './EnhancedUI.module.css'`
   - Fixed component imports:
     - Changed `import Button3D from './components/Button3D'` to `import Button3D from './Button3D'`
     - Changed `import { Card3D, Alert3D } from './components/EnhancedComponents'` to `import { Card3D, Alert3D } from './EnhancedComponents'`

### Verification

## Render Deployment Fix

### Issue
```
ImportError: /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
```

### Root Cause
The psycopg2-binary version 2.9.6 is not compatible with Python 3.13, which is the version being used by Render for the deployment.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Updated psycopg2-binary version in all requirements files**
   - Changed `psycopg2-binary==2.9.6` to `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` in:
     - [requirements.txt](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/requirements.txt) (root directory)
     - [backend/requirements.txt](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/backend/requirements.txt)
     - [backend/requirements-dev.txt](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/backend/requirements-dev.txt)

2. **Added runtime.txt to specify Python version**
   - Created [runtime.txt](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/runtime.txt) with content `python-3.9.18` to ensure compatibility with the psycopg2-binary package

### Reasoning
- psycopg2-binary 2.9.9 has better compatibility with newer Python versions
- Python 3.9.18 is a stable version that's known to work well with the current dependencies
- Specifying the Python version ensures consistent deployment environments

## Next Steps

1. Push all changes to GitHub
2. Trigger new deployments on both Netlify and Render
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any further issues

These fixes should resolve both deployment errors and allow successful deployment of the application.
