# Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes all the fixes made to resolve deployment issues and enhance user experience.

## Issues Addressed

1. **psycopg2 Compatibility Issue**: The error `undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get` was occurring due to compatibility issues between psycopg2 and Python 3.13.

2. **User Viewing Experience**: Screenshots were not being displayed directly in the project gallery view.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. psycopg2 Compatibility Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Changed psycopg2-binary version from 2.9.7 to 2.9.5
- `build.sh`: Enhanced build script to install psycopg2-binary first
- `render.yaml`: Specified Python version 3.11.9
- `backend/runtime.txt`: Specified Python version 3.11.9
- `backend/wsgi.py`: Added better error handling for psycopg2 imports
- `backend/diagnose.py`: Improved psycopg2 diagnostics

**Changes:**
- Downgraded psycopg2-binary to a more stable version (2.9.5)
- Modified build process to install psycopg2-binary before other dependencies
- Specified exact Python version to avoid compatibility issues
- Added better error handling and logging for psycopg2 imports

### 2. Enhanced User Viewing Experience

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/PublicSubmissionsPage.jsx`: Added screenshot previews in gallery view

**Changes:**
- Added direct screenshot previews in the project gallery grid view
- Added placeholder icons for projects without screenshots
- Improved visual hierarchy and user experience

### 3. Additional Improvements

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/migrate.py`: Enhanced database migration script
- Various documentation files updated

**Changes:**
- Improved database migration handling for existing deployments
- Better error messages and logging
- Enhanced deployment documentation

## Testing

All changes have been tested locally to ensure:
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Backend starts without psycopg2 errors
- ✅ Database schema is correctly updated
- ✅ Multiple screenshot functionality works
- ✅ API endpoints function properly
- ✅ Screenshot previews display correctly in gallery view

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push all changes to the main branch
2. Render will automatically deploy using the updated configuration
3. Netlify will automatically deploy the frontend

The application should now deploy successfully on both platforms without the previous errors.

## Expected Improvements

1. **Deployment Success**: The psycopg2 compatibility issues should be resolved
2. **User Experience**: Users will now see screenshot previews directly in the gallery view
3. **Reliability**: Better error handling and logging for easier debugging
4. **Compatibility**: Specified Python version ensures consistent deployment environment
