# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Dependency Mismatch (Render Deployment Issue)
**Problem**: The root `requirements.txt` contained unused dependencies (`Flask-JWT-Extended` and `bcrypt`) that were not actually used in the code.
**Fix**: Removed unused dependencies from the root `requirements.txt` to match the backend `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Environment Configuration (Netlify Deployment Issue)
**Problem**: Potential issues with API endpoint configuration.
**Fix**: Verified that the frontend correctly uses `VITE_API_URL` environment variable with proper fallbacks.

## Deployment Verification Steps

### For Netlify (Frontend):
1. Ensure `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set in Netlify to `https://project-tracker-0ahq.onrender.com`
2. Trigger a new deployment on Netlify
3. Check that the build completes successfully
4. Verify that the frontend can communicate with the backend

### For Render (Backend):
1. Push the updated `requirements.txt` to the repository
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Check that the build completes successfully
4. Verify that the backend is accessible at `https://project-tracker-0ahq.onrender.com`

## Common Troubleshooting Steps

### If Netlify Build Fails:
1. Check the build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies in `frontend/package.json` are correctly installed
3. Ensure the build command `npm run build` works locally

### If Render Build Fails:
1. Check the build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are correctly installed
3. Ensure the start command works locally: `cd backend && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:application`

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit the Netlify frontend URL
2. Try submitting a form to verify API connectivity
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify that the backend API is responding at `https://project-tracker-0ahq.onrender.com/health`
