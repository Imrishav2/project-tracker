# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Dependency Mismatch**: 
   - Removed unused dependencies (`Flask-JWT-Extended` and `bcrypt`) from the root `requirements.txt` file
   - The root `requirements.txt` now matches the backend `requirements.txt` file

2. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added troubleshooting sections to the README.md for both Netlify and Render deployments

## Next Steps

### For Render (Backend) Deployment:
1. Commit and push the updated `requirements.txt` file to your repository
2. Trigger a new deployment on Render
3. Check the deployment logs for any errors

### For Netlify (Frontend) Deployment:
1. Trigger a new deployment on Netlify to rebuild with the current configuration
2. Ensure the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set to your Render backend URL
3. Check the deployment logs for any errors

## If Issues Persist

### For Render:
1. Check the build logs in the Render dashboard
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set:
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `UPLOAD_FOLDER`

### For Netlify:
1. Check the build logs in the Netlify dashboard
2. Verify that the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure the build command completes successfully: `npm run build`

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit your Netlify frontend URL
2. Try submitting a form to verify API connectivity
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify that the backend API is responding at your Render URL + `/health`
