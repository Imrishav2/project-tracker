# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The deployment was failing with a compatibility error between psycopg2-binary and Python 3.13:
```
ImportError: /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
```

## Root Cause
Despite specifying psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 in requirements.txt, the deployment was still installing version 2.9.7, which is not compatible with Python 3.13.

## Solution
1. Modified the build.sh script to:
   - Force reinstall psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 with --force-reinstall flag
   - Use --no-cache-dir to prevent cached packages from being used
   - Use --no-deps when installing other dependencies to prevent dependency resolution from upgrading psycopg2-binary
   - Added package verification steps

2. Added a .python-version file to explicitly specify Python version 3.11.9

## Files Modified
- `build.sh` - Enhanced build process to ensure correct psycopg2-binary version is installed
- `.python-version` - Added to explicitly specify Python version

## Testing
The changes have been committed and are ready for deployment. This should resolve the psycopg2 compatibility issue and allow the application to deploy successfully.
