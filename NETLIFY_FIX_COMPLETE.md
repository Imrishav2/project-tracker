# Netlify Deployment Error Fix - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## Problem Summary
Netlify deployment was failing with:
```
[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'
Require stack:
- /opt/build/repo/frontend/tailwind.config.js
```

## Root Cause
The [tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js) file was requiring the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin, but it wasn't installed as a dependency in [package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json).

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Dependency
```diff
// In frontend/package.json
"devDependencies": {
+   "@tailwindcss/line-clamp": "^0.4.4",
    // ... other dependencies
}
```

### 2. Optimized Configuration (Best Practice)
Since Tailwind CSS v3.3+ includes line-clamp by default, we updated [tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js):
```diff
plugins: [
-   require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
+   // @tailwindcss/line-clamp is included by default in Tailwind CSS v3.3+
]
```

### 3. Cleaned Up Redundant Dependency
Removed unnecessary `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` from [frontend/package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20project/frontend/package.json) after confirming it's built-in.

## Files Modified
1. [frontend/package.json](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/package.json) - Added then removed `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` dependency
2. [frontend/tailwind.config.js](file:///c:/whitelist%20group%20project/frontend/tailwind.config.js) - Updated plugin configuration

## Verification Process
1. ✅ Successfully ran build command without the original error
2. ✅ Confirmed no warnings about missing modules
3. ✅ Verified line-clamp functionality still works (built into Tailwind v3.3+)

## Deployment Instructions
1. Commit and push the updated files to your repository
2. Netlify will automatically rebuild the project
3. Deployment should complete successfully without the module error

## Expected Outcome
The Netlify build will now complete successfully because:
- The required `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` dependency is properly resolved
- The configuration is optimized for Tailwind CSS v3.3+
- No more missing module errors during the PostCSS processing step

This fix directly addresses the error shown in your Netlify logs and should resolve the deployment issue.
