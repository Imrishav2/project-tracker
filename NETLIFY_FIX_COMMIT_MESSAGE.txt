Fix Netlify deployment error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'

- Added missing @tailwindcss/line-clamp dependency to package.json
- Optimized tailwind.config.js since line-clamp is built into Tailwind v3.3+
- Removed redundant dependency after confirming built-in functionality
- Netlify should now build successfully without the module resolution error

Fixes the Netlify build error:
[vite:css] [postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/line-clamp'
